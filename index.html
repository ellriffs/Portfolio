        <p1> My name is Elliot. 30 Years old, born and raised in Manchester, UK.
            I have been an avid musician since picking up my first guitar when i was 7 years old.
            growing up, i made the decision to study music full time throughout college and going on 
            to obtain my Bachelors of Arts (with Honours) from Salford university.
            Since leaving university I have gone on to work with bands and indipendent artists, taking 
            me around Europe touring and performing. It's also given me oppotunites to have
            my work featured in small films and indipendant games. 
            as time has moved forward, my path has taken me in a different direction. Over the last three years,
            i have become increasingly interested in the tech industry and what it has to offer. This has brought me to 
            the descidion to finally take the leap and study software engineering. I am currently enrolled in the
            Software Engineering fastrack course at Manchester Codes and i am loving every second of it. 
            Come and follow my journey as I merge my creativity from my past to my future.
